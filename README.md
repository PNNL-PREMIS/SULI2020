# SULI2020
Planning repository for summer 2020 SULI and high school interns.

Here is the link to Skylar's repo: https://github.com/skygering/land-ocean-warming-ratio.git

Skylar's project involves paramaterizing the land-ocean warming ratio from CMIP6 data and incorporating the paramaterization into simple climate model HECTOR.

Here is the link to Mercedes' repo: https://github.com/mlkhorn/ftc_cosore

Mercedes' project involves investigating trends in winter and freeze thaw period soil respiration using continuous soil respiration data contained in the COSORE database. 

Here is the link to Max's repo: https://github.com/MaxFrissell/SoilRespirationPartitioning

Max's project involves investigating factors that can be used to predict the amount of soil respiration that comes from plant roots versus from soil microorganisms using machine learning.

Here is the link to Colin's repo: https://github.com/10aDing/daynight-Q10

Colin's project involves investigating differences/trends in Day/Night temperature sensitivites (Q10) using continuous soil respiration data contained within the COSORE database.
